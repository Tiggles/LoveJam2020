# Roadtrip

## How to play:

You are in the backseat of your parent's car.

You are in charge of snacks, keeping the radio at the right frequency, and handling directions.

When your dad puts his hand toward you, give him candy, either chocolate or licorice, but never the same thing twice in a row.
Click on the chocolate or licorice to give it to him.

Sometimes, the radiostation's frequency will change, and you will have to find the correct frequency. The frequency is changed
with the up and down buttons.

You have the directions written on a page, that you can look at by holding space down. When your dad prompts you for directions,
click on the direction that matches the directions on the page.
